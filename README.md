# Pong Game

A super basic hockey pong game using SVGs. Pucks can only be hit by players when puck is heading torwards own goal, otherwise they pass it forward. No score limit. Play forever. All players are controlled with the same controls meaning you cannot control players independently. 

The project was an introduction into Object-Oriented Programming with JavaScript, working with some of the new features of ES6 as well as an introduction to creating SVG's with HTML. I learned basic game design concepts such as the game loop, hit-boxes and assigning controls to move rendered SVG's with the keyboard.
